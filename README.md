✅ **Tips to make it look great on GitHub:**

1. Use triple backticks (```` ``` ````) with no language tag — GitHub will preserve spacing.
2. Use `├──`, `└──`, and `│` characters for clean tree formatting (you can type them using `Option + 1`, `Option + 7`, and `Option + Shift + L` on Mac).
3. You can also add emojis or headers for sections (e.g., `### 🧠 Domain Layer`) if you want a more visual README.

Would you like me to format it in a **modern style README** (with sections like Overview, Architecture, Tech Stack, Folder Structure, and Setup)? I can generate that whole README template for you.
